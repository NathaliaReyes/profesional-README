## Description

This project is a professional README generator that automates the process of creating a well-structured and informative README file for software projects. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input project details such as project name, description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, credits, license information, features, contributing guidelines, tests, and contact information. The generator then generates a README file in Markdown format with a table of contents and sections for each of the provided details. This saves developers time and ensures consistency in the documentation of their projects.
