## Description

This webpage is meant to encourage users to stop the mindless scrolling on TikTok, Reddit, Instagram, or whatever media theyâ€™re too plugged into. When users scan the QR code, theyâ€™re presented with a trivia game that is meant to engage their mind, and then theyâ€™re given a suggestion of something to do thatâ€™s not on their phone.
